i didnt like that I am captalisd<br/>
like Him like Us like Jesus paralysd<br/>
whatever marx had said whatever his<br/>
boy beard containd i reckond that it is<br/>
the good i see the bad the ugly stand<br/>
within the pillars of the markets grand<br/>
the active puppets run by puppeteers<br/>
our masters clockwork music of the spheres
