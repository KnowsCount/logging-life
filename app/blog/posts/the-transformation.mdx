i ate the foams of sea insult the shore<br/>
fast dying moribund the less the more<br/>
they also fizzd beneath i swam i heard<br/>
within the ears of fishes when a herd<br/>
of shorebirds plunged the foams gentle birth<br/>
whose death i chocked on nursed in brine stillbirth<br/>
i was a million others vulgar thought<br/>
of being couldnt intervene and nought<br/>
was all there was<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;upon its fizz i soar<br/>
i lie in gasps upon the sea-beat shore<br/>
