in childhood years i hadnt stood a chance<br/>
to sacred songs to dance a vulgar dance<br/>
nor walk at odds with God nor with Him twain<br/>
it seemed sufficient to commit my brain<br/>
to ponder Heaven what there good befall<br/>
or meta heaven if it is at all<br/>
thus days went on in the old house whose clock<br/>
strikes every second (strikes too much <i>ad hoc</i>)<br/>
beneath i slept so many dom√®d dreams<br/>
within its song the deathless knell it streams<br/>

i cried upon the bed one youthful night<br/>
beside my dad i cried till blisters bite<br/>
beneath my eyebags dad had heard me cry<br/>
he looked at me and saw my futile try<br/>
to puzzle out my tears they run a line<br/>
he told me everything was going fine<br/>
hes still okay its years till he should die<br/>
my tears they didnt mean this didnt i<br/>
the rest i could recall that night was sleep<br/>

my mother took me on a roaring jeep<br/>
we drove half clinging to a cliff beneath<br/>
was endless pitfall sightless certain death<br/>
the turkish driver bit on words the end<br/>
he grinned is near i heard the end impend<br/>
ten minutes passed in dead forlorn old town<br/>
and palace bricks of long gone king and clown<br/>
he parkd the car and blade and cork they whizzd<br/>
some babbling bubbles spurted out they fizzd
