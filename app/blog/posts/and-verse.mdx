it is not silent it just doesnt spell<br/>
blind homer asks the muses nine to tell<br/>
his eyes a story of the man between<br/>
my eyes and its new ken the nest i preen<br/>
whose twigs the man old chap has grown<br/>
beneath the watchful skies forever known

it was the day the first day of my life<br/>
i ceased to fear the coming afterlife<br/>
the clockwork ticks were all that sounds to me<br/>
sans wants and needs of petite bourgeoisie
