the buttons on my shirt some loving mums<br/>
of not the dearest sons the old school chums<br/>
since mother time was growing clockwork dumb<br/>
some morsels of some round white glistening crumb<br/>
we stole from her the b in crumb is mum<br/>
and mum concreted was in dutch a scum<br/>
she made time fly a minute hand ago<br/>
i was a solemn child<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; he now must go.
